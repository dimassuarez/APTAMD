 The enhanced MD methods allow the calculation of a potential of mean force by 
 estimating the canonical probability distribution p(A) along a selected 
 coordinate. To this end, the probability distribution p*(A) derived from 
 the enhanced simulation must be reweighted as,

 p(A_j)=p*(A_j) * < exp( V(r) /kT ) >_j / Sum_i < exp( V(r) /kT ) >_i  
 
 i=1, 2, ..., M 

 where V is the boost potential and M is the selected number of bins
 along the A coordinate. The GAMD approach adopts a harmonic boost potential 
 that results in an accurate approximation of the exponential reweighting 
 terms through a cumulant expansion to the second order (CE2). 

 < exp( V(r) /kT ) > ~= exp ( <V>/kT + (<V^2> - <V>^2)/(2(kT)^2)  )

 The CE2 approach is implemented in the Python scripts developed by Miao .
 In particular, do_reweight_gamd.sh calls the PyReweighting-2D.py script
 retrieved from http://miaolab.org/PyReweighting/.
 Further details about GAMD reweighting can be found at:
 http://miaolab.org/GaMD/ and the references cited therein.

 The do_reweight_gamd.sh script usually represents 2D free energy maps in terms 
 of the RMSD/INF coordinates, selecting a number of bins M=~15-20 along 
 each coordinate. The resulting 2D map is plotted in the CE2.png file.
 In addition, the unweighted population distribution over 
 the 2D bins is also plotted (CE2_pop.png). The representative
 snapshots are extracted from the subset of GaMD snapshots located within 
 a low energy basin in the free energy map. In particular, the snapshots that 
 have the lower values of the boost potential are selected, which would be 
 presumably closer to those structures that populate the canonical NPT ensemble. 

 A careful inspection of the the selected snapshots is recommended.
