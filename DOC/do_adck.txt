        GEUO SUITE: Scripts for Automating Molecular Modelling Tasks
###############################################################################
  
  SCRIPT's NAME:  do_adck.sh

  GOAL:  To run a series of docking calculations using NREC receptor
         geometries and NLIG ligand geometries. Ligands can move all around
         the receptor molecules (i.e., no binding site is pressuposed).
         It is assumed that All the required pdbqt and AutoGrid/Autodock input 
         files have been generated by the preliminary execution of 
         do_adck_templates.sh

         See $GEUO/DOC/ADCK.txt file for further details about the
         docking and rescoring protocols implemented in this script.
  

  USAGE : do_adck.sh  RECEPTOR_PDB_LIST LIGAND_PDB_LIST
          
          where RECEPTOR_PDB_LIST and LIGAND_PDB_LIST are the filenames
          of two separate files containing in turn a list of PDB filenames
          Each PDB file (selected for example from cluster representatives
          obtained in previous MD simulations) will be used in the subsequent
          docking calculations. 
 
          do_adck.sh  input.src       
 
  If the input filename has src extension then do_aptamer_edition.sh sources 
  it. The src file should contain variable declarations for the various options 
  indicated below.

  This script must be called from the docking directory created/selected
  previously by users. 

  OPTIONS: (selected by environment variables) 

    RECEPTOR_PDB_LIST="R.txt"  # Input file containing the list of PDB
                               # files with coordinates of the receptor
                               # No default value
    LIGAND_PDB_LIST="L.txt"    # Idem for Ligand

    NPROCS=6           # Number of cores to be used. Def all available.

    GRID="0.333"       # Grid size of the Autogrid maps . Def =0.333 Ang

    GA_RUN="50"        # Number of GA runs to request in the ADCK calcs.
                       # NOTE: A total of NREC x NLIG x GA poses will be
                       # produced. Def = 50 

    DO_DOCKING="YES"   # If DO_DOCKING=NO then the script will search
