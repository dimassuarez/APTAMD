        GEUO SUITE: Scripts for Automating Molecular Modelling Tasks

  To characterize the shape and conformation of the peptide/apatmer molecule
  along the MD simulations, different structural indexes can be computed. 

  RMSD
  ====
  The root-mean-squared-deviation (RMSD) of selected heavy atoms 
  with respect to a reference structure. For peptide molecules,
  only the heavy atoms of the backbone chain are considered. 
  For aptamers, all the P,C,N,O atoms are considered. 
  For long molecules (NRES>10), the first and last pair or residues
  are not taken into account.

  Radius of gyration
  ==================
  All heavy atoms are taken into account in the calculation of the
  radius of gyration

  INF: interaction network fidelity (RNA, 2009, 15, 1875)
  =========================================================
  The so-called interaction network fidelity index (INF) is built
  from the sets of characteristic intramolecular interactions in a reference 
  structure (Sr) and in a given snapshot (Sm). 
   Hence, the INF value is computed from: 

  (i) the set of common interactions between the two structures, 
      which are counted as true positives.  Tp= Sr /\ Sm 

  (ii) the set of the interactions in the reference structure that are 
   not present in the MD snapshot, which are false positives. Fp= Sm \ Sr 

  (iii) the number of interactions absent in the MD snapshot, but present
   in the reference structure, which are termed false negatives. Fn= Sr \ Sm

  The INF index is defined  as a Mathews correlation coefficient considering 
  true and false positives and negatives: 

  INF = sqrt (  ( |Tp| / ( |Tp| + |Fp|  ) ) * ( |Tp| / ( |Tp| + |Fn| ) )  ) 
  				
  If the snapshot reproduces all the interactions of the reference structure, 
  then |FP|=|FN|=0, and INF= 1. When the snapshot does not reproduce any of 
  the interactions of the reference structure, then INF=0, since |TP|= 0. 

  To determine interactions in the aptamer molecules, we employ the DSSR software
  to identify both base pair interactions and non-pair interactions (i.e., 
  base stacking or base contacts). For peptide molecules, we employ cpptraj to
  identify and categorizae intramolecular H-bond contacts.
