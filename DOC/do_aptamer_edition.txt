        GEUO SUITE: Scripts for Automating Molecular Modelling Tasks
###############################################################################
  
  SCRIPT's NAME:  do_aptamer_edition.sh

  GOAL: 
  Starting from an aptamer pdb file, this scripts performs the following tasks:
     1) partial relaxation of sugar and base moieties
     2) tleap edition adding counterions to satisfy the required ionic force
  
  The script selects the bsc1 (DNA) and TIP3P (water) force field models.
  To use other FFs, make a copy of the script and adapt it to your particular 
  choices.

  USAGE : do_aptamer_edition.sh  MOL_initial.pdb 

  where "MOL_initial.pdb" is the initial PDB file. Note that MOL is the alias 
  of the project associated to this system. For example, a valid filename can 
  be aptX_initial.pdb, but not aptX.pdb. If the initial PDB file is generated
  by RNAComposer then some residues and atoms are renamed to match DNA. 
 
          do_aptamer_edition.sh  input.src       
 
  If the input filename has src extension then do_aptamer_edition.sh sources 
  it. The src file should contain variable declarations for the options 
  indicated below.

  This script must be called from the edition directory.
  See $GEUO/DOC/directory_tree.txt for details.

  OPTIONS: (selected by environment variables) 

    INITIAL="MOL_initial.pdb"  # PDB input filename
    IONIC=0.150                # NaCl(aq) Ionic strength. Def is 0.150 M.
    BUFFER_SOLV=16.0           # Solvent buffer used to build the 
                               # octahedral periodic box. Def 16.0 Angstrom
    MAXCYC=500                 # Maximum opt cycles for sugar and backbone
                               # relaxation. Def is 500.
