  Some common MD settings                                 
  =======================
  Langevin dynamics is employed to control the temperature (300 K) 
  with a collision frequency of 2 ps-1. 
  The SHAKE algorithm is applied to constraint all R-H bonds, 
  Periodic boundary conditions are activated to simulate a continuous system 
  at constant pressure (NTP). 
  A non-bonded cutoff of 9.0 Å is used and the Particle-Mesh-Ewald method 
  is employed to include the contributions of long-range interactions
  
  Initial relaxation
  ==================
  The solvent molecules and counterions are initially relaxed by means of 
  energy minimizations and 100 ps of molecular dynamics (MD) using SANDER.  
  After solvent MD, the full system is minimized by 2500 conjugate-gradient
  steps. 

  Thermalization
  ==============
  The full system is heated gradually ( T= 100, 150, 200, 250, 300 K ) along
  60 ps of constant volume (NVT) MD with a 1 fs time step and using the PMEMD 
  program (MPI version).

  Pressurization
  ==============
  The density is adjusted by means of 2.0 ns of constant pressure (NPT) MD 
  with a 2 fs time step and using the Monte Carlo barostat as implemented 
  in PMEMD,

  Production Runs
  ===============
  Conventional MD production runs at NPT conditions are carried out using 
  PMEMD (CUDA) and the same ettings of the pressurization stage. 
  The production phase consists of a series of MD jobs (50 ns each) that is 
  usually extended to the µs timescale. Coordinates are saved for analysis
  every 2.5 ps. After each MD job, coordinates are usually postprocessed
  to produce two sets of trajectory files: i) only solute atoms ; 
  ii) solute and counterions + a water shell. The later set is saved only
  every 50 ps. 

  Specific GAMD settings
  ======================
  GaMD performs an enhanced and unconstrained sampling of the systems using 
  harmonic boost potentials to smooth out the potential energy surface
  Two boost potentials are applied: one to the torsion energetic term and 
  another to the total potential energetic term including waters and ions. 
  The upper limits of both boost potentials are set to 6.0 kcal/mol. 
  The threshold energy E and harmonic constant k are estimated from the average 
  and standard deviation of potential energies. Following the recommended 
  prescriptions in the AMBER manual, the specific GaMD keywords are adjusted
  to the total number of atoms (NAT) in the system. 

  NTAVE=4xNAT steps used to update potential energy statistics . 
  NTCMD=14*NTAVE MD steps done to obtain an initial guess for E and k. 
  NTBEPREP=NTCMD GaMD steps for equilibration
  NTBE=10*NTCMD GaMD steos for refining E and k
