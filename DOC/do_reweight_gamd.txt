        GEUO SUITE: Scripts for Automating Molecular Modelling Tasks
###############################################################################
  
  SCRIPT's NAME:  do_rw_gamd.sh   

  GOAL: 

  To reweight the probability distribution function (PDF) derived from a GAMD
  simulation of a peptide or aptamer molecule to recover the equilibrium
  (canonical) PDF and estimate 2D free energy maps in terms of the RMSD/INF 
  and/or RGYR/RMSD coordinates as calculated by the do_struct.sh script.
  The scripts also picks up a selection of GAMD snapshots belonging to the
  most likely structures. 

  See $GEUO/DOC/reweight.txt for details.
 
  USAGE : do_rw_gamd.sh   "MOL1 MOL2 ..."   

  where MOL1, MOL2 (enclosed in quotation marks) are the project alias of
  the GAMD trajectories of interest. 
 
          do_rw_gamd.sh  input.src       
 
  If the input filename has src extension then do_rw_gamd.sh sources the 
  lines in the src file that should contain variable declarations for 
  the various options indicated below.

  First call to this script must be done at the main directory where the GAMD 
  directories are located. Subsequent calls can be done from the RW_DIR 
  subdirectory containing intermediate data (this saves CPU time).
  See also $GEUO/DOC/directory_tree.txt for further details.

  OPTIONS: (selected by environment variables) 

    MOL='alias'        # System alias. Several aliases can be grouped
                       # into a single variable MD_TRAJ='MOL1 MOl2 ...'
    ENE='6.0'          # Upper threshold energy limit in the 2D map 
                       # Def = 6.0 kcal/mol 
    FINEGRID='NO'      # Whether to use finer or coarser grid in
                       # binning of the 2D map. Usually better results
                       # are obtained with a regular (coarser) grid.
                       # Def NO
    NGRID_FINE='25'    # Number of bin intervals along each dimension
                       # in a fine grid. Def 25. 
    NGRID_REG='15'     # Bin intervals in a regular grid. Def 15.
    RW_DIR='RW_GAMD_ENE'  # Directory in which to save the output files
    DO_INF_RMSD='YES'  # Build a 2D free energy map in terms of the 
                       # INF and RMSD coordinates. This is the default
                       # and recommended. 
    DO_RGYR_RMSD='NO'  # Build a 2D free energy map in terms of the
                       # RMSD and RGYR coordinates. Usually not 
                       # recommended. Def. NO. 
    DATA_DIR='STRUCT'  # Directory containing the RMSD, RGYR 
                       # and INF data as calculated by 
                       # do_struct.sh
    SIEVE=1           # If a SIEVE > 1 was used when running 
                      # do_rmsd_rgyr_inf.sh,  it must be used here too.

    Since the script also selects some representative GAMD frames that 
    could be used for visualization and subsequent MD simulations, 
    the usual options specifiyng the location of the GAMD trajectory
    files can be passed to do_rw_gamd.sh.

    MD_PROD='5.PRODUCTION'
    PREFIX_MDCRD='md_'
    SUFFIX_MDCRD='_solute.mdcrd'

    The list of mdcrd files to be processed is buitl by the command:
    ls ${MD_PROD}/${PREFIX_MDCRD}*{SUFFIX_MDCRD}
    The default values are suitable for trajectories generated with do_runmd.sh
