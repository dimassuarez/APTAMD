Docking Protocol
================

To explore different binding modes between aptamers and targets, we performe
rigid docking calculations. To describe all protein, sugar, and DNA units 
on an equal basis, we use Autodock 4.2, a standalone program initially developed 
to dock small and flexible ligands to proteins, DNA, RNA, and other macromolecules. 
Compared to the other docking programs, Autodock is computationally more demanding
because it uses a physics-based scoring function that includes specific terms to 
model van der Waals, electrostatic, and H-bond interactions as well as a desolvation
contribution to the binding free energy. 

Starting from the coordinate files of the receptor and the igand, the Python scripts 
included in MGLTools are used to assign atom types and Gasteiger charges, and to merge 
non-polar hydrogens. To explore multiple binding options, Autodock requires precalculated 
grid maps for the receptor, in which information on electrostatics, H-bond and steric 
constraints are stored for each atom type in the ligand. Grid maps are centered on the
COM of the receptor and the grid big enough to allow the ligands to rotate/translate around 
the receptor and produce different binding poses. 

To sample the receptor/ligand conformational space, we use the genetic search algorithm 
to generate 500 conformations that are clustered with an RMSD tolerance of 2.0 Ã…. 
To remove band contacts, the docking poses fully relaxed,  introducing thus some 
flexibility in the docking protocol. Using SANDER, we run 5000 steps of conjugate gradient 
minimization on each structure and using the Hawkins, Cramer, Truhlar pairwise 
generalized Born implicit solvent model46. After the geometry optimization, the 
minimized structures are finally ranked using the Autodock scoring function.
