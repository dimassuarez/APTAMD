        GEUO SUITE: Scripts for Automating Molecular Modelling Tasks
###############################################################################
  
  SCRIPT's NAME:  do_sconform.sh        

  GOAL:  To carry out all tasks and calculations required to obtain the 
         conformational entropy of solute molecules from MD trajectories
         using the entropy methods implemented in CENCALC 

  USAGE : do_sconform "MOL1 MOL2"  MD_TYPE  IFRAG  DO_CC_MLA

  where MOL1, MOL2 (enclosed in quotation marks) are the project alias of
  the MD trajectories of interest. MD_TYPE can be either "MD" or "GAMD". 
  IFRAG=0, 1, 2 , ... selects the solute molecule (0=all solute atoms) 
  DO_CC_MLA=0 or 1  selects ether first-order entropy (0) or CC-MLA
  entropies (1)

          do_sconform.sh  input.src       
 
  If the input filename has src extension then do_sconform.sh sources 
  it. The src file should contain variable declarations for the various options 
  indicated below.

  This script must be called from the main directory where the MD/GAMD 
  directories are located. See $GEUO/DOC/directory_tree.txt for details.

  OPTIONS: (selected by environment variables) 

    MOL='alias'        # Project alias. Several aliases can be grouped
                       # into a single variable MD_TRAJ='MOL1 MOl2 ...'
    MD_TYPE='MD'       # Either MD or GAMD

    NPROCS=6           # Number of cores to be used. Def all available.

    IFRAG=0            # Selects the solute molecule. Def IFRAG=0 
                       # selects all solute atoms 
    SCONFORM_DIR='SCONFORM'   # Name of the subdirectory in which
                              # the entropy calcs are saved. Def SCONFORM

    DO_CC_MLA=0        # Only first-order entropy calcs are performed (Def)
    DO_CC_MLA=1        # After first-order calcs, CC-MLA method is performed
    DO_CC_MLA=2        # Assumes a previous run of do_soncorm and discretization
                       # tasks (time consuming) are skipped
    COMPOSITE=NO       # If YES then the composite version of CC-MLA is used.
                       # so that torsions are classified into different groups
                       # attending to their pair correlations.
    CUTOFF=-1          # No distance-based cutoff is used in the calculation of
                       # CC-MLA entropies  (Default)

    CUTOFF="6 8 10 ..." # A list of cutoff distances to be considered by the 
                        # CC-MLA method. The optimal cutoff is determined
                        # by fitting the Sconform against cutoff distances

    GETTOR_OPT="-noMet -puck"  # Options passed to the gettor.py script included
                               # in the CENCALC suite. These options filter
                               # torsion angles. Default is to excluded torsions
                               # of methyl groups and use puckering angles for
                               # Pro/Hyp rings

    PERCEN=0           # Percentage of MD trajectory data to be considered
                       # by the entropy calcs (0=full trajectory). If PERCEN="-50"
                       # then the last half is used. If PERCEN="50" the first half
                       # is used. 

    MD_PROD='5.PRODUCTION'
    PREFIX_MDCRD='md_'
    SUFFIX_MDCRD='_solute.mdcrd'

    The list of mdcrd files to be processed is built by the command:

    ls ${MD_PROD}/${PREFIX_MDCRD}???{SUFFIX_MDCRD}
