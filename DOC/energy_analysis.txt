The MM/PBSA-like energy of a biomolecule (G) is normally derived from
averages of calculations on snapshots extracted from MD simulations. 
Typically, after having removed all solvent molecules and counterions 
in explicit solvent simulations). These energies are computed according 
to the following kind of equations: 

G = 3*R*T + E_MM + DG_solv 
 		
where E_MM is the gas-phase energy, 3RT is due to six translational 
and rotational degrees of freedom and DG_solv is the solvation energy, which 
is decomposed into polar and nonpolar contributions. Many specific methods and 
approximations have been used to calculate E_MM and DG_solv. Most commonly, 
the gas-phase energy is obtained using MM force fields, but quantum mechanical 
(QM) and hybrid QM/MM methods can be also employed. The electrostatic solvation 
energy is normally estimated by means of implicit solvent methods like the 
Poisson-Boltzmann (PB)and Generalized-Born (GB)  methods. Both PB and GB 
represent the solute molecule in terms of a set of atomic charges and 
parameterized radii, but while PB determines the solute electrostatic 
potential through the numerical solution of the Poisson equation, GB is 
based on a modified Coulombic expression that is computationally faster. 

The electrostatic PB(GB) solvation energies must be complemented with 
the corresponding nonpolar part due to cavity formation and van der Waals 
interactions between the solute and the solvent molecules. 
Effective nonpolar solvent models that treat separately the cavity 
(repulsive) and dispersion (attractive) energies are preferred. 
The post-processing of explicit solvent MD simulations also allows 
the evaluation of the dispersion part by computing the average 
van der Waals interaction energy between solute and the water molecules 
within a shell of 12-15 Ã… thickness. Alternatively, the PB(GB) and 
nonpolar solvation energies can be replaced by those calculated with 
the three-dimensional reference interaction site model (3D-RISM). 
This method, which is based on a first-principles statistical mechanics theory, 
yields the 3D distribution functions of the solvent atoms around each solute site
allowing thus specific descriptions of polar and non-polar solvation effects 
for each solute-solvent interaction site, albeit with larger computational cost 
than that of the PB(GB)SA methods.


The binding free energy estimate obtained with MM-PBSA-like methods consists 
of the difference of average G energies derived from three independent 
simulations, that is, 

DG_bind = G_cmplx  - G_host  - G_lig 

For a host-ligand complex, the interaction energy can be computed by 
averaging relative G values: . 

DG_int = G_cmplx  - G_host*  - G_lig* 

In this expression, the asterisk means that the G energies of the host and 
ligand molecules are evaluated using their distorted geometries in the complex. 
In the case of small ligands, DG_bind may be approximated by DG_int.
This is the so-called one-trajectory approximation, which minimizes statistical 
uncertainty and facilitates the estimation of relative affinities 
for a series of ligand molecules.  However, for relatively large complexes 
in which a substantial structural rearrangement takes place upon binding, 
the one-trajectory approximation ignores the distortion effects.
